["index.html", "Tayside Acute Care Guide", " Tayside Acute Care Guide BY PAUL FETTES This guide is aimed at medical students and junior doctors to enable them to know what to do in an acute situation. It is the culmination of a lot of work by a lot of people. It is designed for use in Tayside and has many specific protocols and contact numbers for that reason, but many of the approaches described are generic and it will have much wider application. Please use this guide with care and a healthy dose of common sense. It should not be relied upon to replace clinical knowlege or experience and the first thing you should do in many of the situations is call for senior help. Your feedback is vital to the development of this guide. Please contact me via the feedback page if you have any feedback, if links don’t work or are out of date, if anything is missing, or if you can think of a way of improving it. "],

Each patient will require a tailored treatment plan for their acute insult. Broadly speaking, each critically unwell patient will need basic assessment and investigations to be performed in a bid to gain a diagnosis / differential list while a basic resuscitation is initiated and subsequently tailored as clinical / laboratory information becomes available. Basic Principles (apply to both categories): GET HELP IMMEDIATELY – Medical / Nursing / HAN etc Resuscitation of a patient requires a co-ordinated team response Follow ABCDE Approach and FREQUENTLY REASSES A Team Leader should co-ordinate events (usually most senior member of staff) Gather information – Patient (if able), Notes, Charts, Allergy Bands, Staff on Ward Communication as a Team is VITAL During the initial phase of resuscitation, a co-ordinated assessment of ABCDE must occur efficiently with each member of the team appointed to a system(s) or tasks. Often assessments and interventions can be carried synchronously with one person assessing and another attaching monitoring, cannulating and taking bloods etc. AssessmentInterventions Interventions Clinical Monitoring Airway Patent / Talking Additional Noises (wheeze / stridor) Airway Positioning (?Link) Adjuncts (Nasopharyngeal or Guedel) Is Definitive Airway Required?

There are many acute medical and surgical presentations which shall be covered in the coming chapters. With all critically unwell patients, consideration of escalation of level of care should be considered. This could be to Coronary Care, High Dependency Unit (Medical or Surgical) or even Intensive Care. The decision to escalate should be made by the most senior members of the team present, bearing in mind that a ceiling of treatment may need to be considered. The following criteria may guide when it is appropriate to consider referral to the Intensive Care Unit: Links SEWS Shock Massive Transfusion Code Red AVPU or GCS AVPU A – Alert and Communicating V – Responds only to Voice P – Responds only to Pain U – Unresponsive GCS Score MINIMUM 3 to MAXIMUM 15 E 4 Eyes open spontaneously E 3 Eyes open to Voice E 2 Eyes open to Pain E 1 No opening of the eyes M 6 Obeys Commands M 5 Localises to Stimulus M 4 Flexes to Painful Stimulus M 3 Abnormal Flexion to Pain M 2 Extends to Painful Stimulus M 1 No Motor Response V 5 Orientated Speech V 4 Confused content of Speech V 3 Inappropriate Speech V 2 Incomprehensible Speech V 1 No Vocal Response Even programme where tick boxes and generates number Blood Samples for Lab Selected from ICE menu – Think about: FBC, Co-agulation Screen / INR U+E’s, Calcium, Magnesium, LFT’s, CRP, Amylase, Troponin Lactate, Glucose Group and Save, Cross Match Blood Cultures – Peripheral and Central ATOMFC Acronym for Life-Threatening Airway Insults A – Airway Loss T – Tension Pneumothorax O – Open Pneumothorax M – Massive Haemothorax F – Flail Chest C – Cardiac Tamponade Advanced Life Support Code Red Major Incident / Mass Casualty Incident 1.2 Major Incident 1.3 Haemodynamically Unstable Polytrauma (Code Red) 1.4 Adult Massive Haemorrhage Policy 1.5 Reversing oral anticoagulants in massive haemorrhage "],
